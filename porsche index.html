        <b>Brief history of Porsche!</b>
        <br/>
        <p>Founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche under the name Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH, the company headquarters were based in Stuttgart Germany. The original focus of Porsche was not building cars but development and consulting of motor vehicles. One early assignments saw the German government task Porsche with designing a car for the people. The resulting car was called the Volkswagen Beetle which became one of the most successful car design of all time. In 1939 Porsche used the design and development of the Beetle to produce their own car called the Porsche 64.

            During World War II production turned towards military requirements with Porsche designing several heavy tanks during the war. At the conclusion of the war in 1945, the Volkswagen factory fell into the hands of the British, and Ferdinand Porsche was arrested for war crimes later that year. During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand was never tried. His son, Ferry Porsche, was tasked with steering the company through a difficult time and went ahead with developing a new car called the Porsche 356. Built in a small sawmill in Austria, the 356 is considered by many to be the first true Porsche, as it was the first car to be sold by the fledgling company.
            
            Post World War II has seen many car manufacturers achieve tremendous sales success, with Porsche right amongst them. Key to the longevity of the brand has been the 911 sports car, the most famous badge in the companies history and one of the most well-known cars in the world.

        <b><ol>The 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS</ol></b>

        <br/>
        <p>Porsche have revealed their most extreme 911 GT3 RS yet, with aero straight from their motorsport program. Fair to say this is pushing the limits of a track focused road car with the most aggressive aero package we’ve seen yet on a 911 GT3.

            With so many new parts to play with the GT3 RS is actually a little heavier than the regular GT3 despite the liberal use of carbon fibre. To help compensate, Porsche has given the RS a little extra power bump taking the new total up to 517 hp. This is thanks to a new cam profile, single-throttle intake system and rigid valve drive taken from Porsche’s race cars. The only transmission option is a seven-speed PDK with a shorter final drive.

        <p>Inspired by the original Boxster concept from 1993, Porsche are celebrating 25 years since their roadster hit the road. Called the Porsche Boxster 25 Years Edition, production will be limited to 1,250 units and marks the 25th anniversary since the first production Boxster was driven out of the factory in 1996.

            The styling has been modelled on the 1993 concept car using the same GT Silver paintwork with copper-like Neodyme accents on the front bumper, side intakes and bespoke 20-inch wheels. Those wheels are what really set this Boxster apart, they have a polished lip and look great on the Boxster, giving it a style no other Boxster has from the factory. The fabric roof has been finished in a contrasting red colour that works well with the accents, and is matched with the same red colouring on the interior.

            <b><ol>2022 Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT</ol></b>

            <br/>
            <p>The Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT has been unveiled as the flagship SUV in the Porsche line-up with no hybrid or electric assistance to be seen. The only body style available for the Turbo GT is the coupe, which features a steeper rake at the back of the roof line to give it a sleeker, sportier look. The front bumper design has been altered to help differentiate the Turbo GT from the regular Turbo Coupe, as it has bigger openings and a new lower spoiler profile.

                A 4.0L twin turbocharged V8 engine straight from the Panamera Turbo S has been employed here to deliver 631 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. Porsche haven’t just left it at that though, with the engine undergoing some tweaks to the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons. These changes have been coupled with an ECU upgrade that all up increases power by 10 hp and torque by 22 lb-ft over the unit in the Panamera.</p>

                <b><ol>2022 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport</ol></b>

                <br/>
                <p>A homologated race car version of the Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS road car, the Clubsport is a ready to race customer car. Designed for use in any SRO racing series, it continues the legacy of Porsche Motorsport developed Cayman Clubsport race cars. The GT4 RS Clubsport is of course the best yet, with more power, more torque, more gears, a higher redline and improved aero.</p>

                <b><ol>2025 Porsche 911 Carrera T</ol></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Porsches newest 911 Carrera T tries to hit the sweet spot with a paired back, lightweight and manual gearbox package. With the use of lightweight windows, optional fixed-back bucket seats, the aforementioned manual transmission and a reduction in sound insulation, the 911 Carrera T tips the scales 42kg less than a Carrera. Porsche have also fitted bigger brakes, rear-wheel steering with a quicker rack, PASM sports suspension that sits 10mm lower than normal and a chassis setup for a neutral handling balance.</p>
                <br/>
                <b><ol>2024 Porsche 718 Spyder RS</ol></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Porsche’s 718 Spyder gets a power boost thanks to the 4.0L Flat 6 engine from the Cayman GT4 RS. With a redline of 9,000 rpm, peak power output of 493 hp and peak torque figure of 332 lb-ft, the 718 Spyder is the new range-topping mid-engined drop-top in Porsche’s line-up. The 0-62 mph sprint is dispatched in 3.4 seconds, the same time it takes the GT4 RS and will hit 191 mph for its top speed, which is 5 mph more than the standard 718 Spyder</p>
